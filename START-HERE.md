# Current report step - R17.8 read-only date-boundary R03

Follow [R03 receiving steps](handoff/report-native-only-r17.8/date-boundary-r03/README.md).
R02 returned CHECK_STOPPED / RuntimeError without identifying the failed step.
It requested no model/source write, refresh or publication. Do not rerun R02.
R03 retains safe checkpoints and any successful reads if another read fails.

The operator reported R17.7 TEST refresh Completed, but summaries/chart stay
blank even after applying once, and saved-file metadata shows Dec 1899.

The returned R01 diagnostic confirms all THREE October source rows inside TEST
have invalid IMS/EF cutoff metadata; the native helper matches them exactly.
Both selected ADS sources are affected. SourceOK=1, but cutoff/fit/period gates
fail. This is not proof that physical Lakehouse or Excel dates are wrong.

Current action: copy the WHOLE read-only CHECK DATE BOUNDARY R03.py from
handoff/report-native-only-r17.8/date-boundary-r03/ into ONE NEW Python/PySpark
cell in ForecastMaster_GM_Setup and run ONLY that cell ONCE. Return the JSON.
It compares physical Lakehouse date types/counts, TEST date bindings and month
keys. No financial amounts, model/source writes, refresh or publication.
Return the final JSON even for PARTIAL/STOPPED. Do not rerun R01/R02, any updater
or the TEST refresh. Keep the existing notebook Spark/Lakehouse context.

The compact R17.8 native SAMPLE is available for optional Desktop layout
review with FABRICATED DATA. It has one readable selectable file list with
import time, no Apply/Source selection controls, compact right-aligned trends
and dynamic title above the plot. All native visual rectangles are separated;
page height is 29% shorter. Native rendering still needs the receiving laptop.

No R17.8 TEST ZIP or updater is published. The source adapter is a local draft,
not installed or numerically qualified. Keep the existing private backup and
production R16.6. The blank/date cause must be resolved before a new TEST update.
Original laptop connection setup follows for reference.

# Connect the Abbott laptop using VS Code and SSH

Use the GitHub account `ayushrocks012`. Open **VS Code → Terminal → New Terminal** and choose **PowerShell** from the terminal profile dropdown. These steps use a laptop-specific SSH key and repository-local Git settings; they do not need the Windows ssh-agent service or an elevated terminal.

## 1. Check the commands

Run:

```powershell
git --version
ssh -V
```

If either command is unavailable, send that exact message in the chat before continuing.

## 2. Create a key for this laptop

Open [setup/1-create-ssh-key.txt](setup/1-create-ssh-key.txt), click **Raw**, and copy its contents into the PowerShell terminal. It creates a new named key only if that file does not already exist, and copies its **public key** to the clipboard. Follow ssh-keygen's prompts.

The `.pub` file is the public key. The key without `.pub` is the SSH credential and stays on this laptop, outside this repository.

## 3. Add the public key to GitHub

In the browser, sign in as **ayushrocks012** and open [GitHub SSH keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).

Select **New SSH key**. Set Title to **Abbott laptop - ForecastMaster**, keep **Authentication Key**, paste the clipboard contents into **Key**, then select **Add SSH key**. See [GitHub's key setup instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

## 4. Test the SSH connection

In the same PowerShell terminal, run:

```powershell
ssh -T -i "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519_forecastmaster" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes git@github.com
```

On the first connection, SSH may ask whether to trust GitHub's host key. Compare the displayed fingerprint with [GitHub's official fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints), then answer the prompt. The Ed25519 fingerprint recorded on 20 October 2026 is:

```text
SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU
```

Expected response:

```text
Hi ayushrocks012! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

GitHub returns exit code 1 for this successful shell-access test; the greeting confirms authentication. A different error should be returned to the chat. See [GitHub's connection test](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection).

## 5. Clone and open the repository

Open [setup/2-clone-with-ssh.txt](setup/2-clone-with-ssh.txt), select **Raw**, and paste it into the PowerShell terminal. It clones into:

```text
C:\Users\YOUR-WINDOWS-USER\source\forecastmaster-coordination
```

It configures the selected SSH executable and key only for this repository and opens the folder in VS Code. If the `code` command is unavailable, use **File → Open Folder** and select the path printed by the script.

The installer is then available in VS Code at:

```text
handoff\notebook-r05.4\INSTALL NOTEBOOK R05.4.txt
```

Copy that entire file when we resume the Fabric installation. The current installer changes the existing `ForecastMaster_Refresh` item and saves a backup; it does not start ingestion or enable a schedule. R05.4 preserves imported revisions and disables automatic Delta purging. The original R05.3 package remains available; use R05.4 for the next installation.

## 6. Exchange updates and screenshots

Before receiving a new script handoff, run in this repository's terminal:

```powershell
git status --short
git pull --ff-only
```

Save screenshots in `feedback/screenshots/` and text output in `feedback/logs/`. Update `feedback/STATUS.md` with what you ran and the result. Filenames such as `2026-10-20-hourly-output.png` make it clear which run they belong to.

To send those feedback files, open [setup/3-send-feedback.txt](setup/3-send-feedback.txt), select **Raw**, and paste its contents into the terminal. It stages only the feedback folder, commits it, pushes `main`, and prints the commit ID. Tell me that ID in this chat so I can fetch the new output.

You can also use GitHub's **Add file → Upload files** inside the feedback folder. Afterwards, run `git pull --ff-only` in VS Code to receive that web upload.

Commit your feedback before receiving edits to those same files from the other side. If Git reports a conflict or refuses a command, return its message; these scripts do not reset or discard local work.

All files in this repository, including uploaded screenshots and logs, are public. This repository does not start Fabric jobs, schedule background synchronization, or change the original application repository.
