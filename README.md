# ForecastMaster coordination

A separate repository for exchanging ForecastMaster setup scripts, office-laptop screenshots, and run output. Start with [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md).

This repository is public. Files and screenshots committed here are publicly visible.

- Current notebook updater: [INSTALL NOTEBOOK R05.4.txt](handoff/notebook-r05.4/INSTALL%20NOTEBOOK%20R05.4.txt)
- Current authentication correction: [hourly user context setup](handoff/pipeline-user-context-r01/README.md)
- Original R05.3 handoff: [retained package](handoff/notebook-r05.3/README.txt)
- Published function source: [ForecastMaster-Actions-R05-2.txt](handoff/functions-r05.2/ForecastMaster-Actions-R05-2.txt)
- New native ad hoc extension, locally qualified and awaiting company installation:
  [native setup and receiving steps](handoff/native-adhoc-r01/README.md)
- Company setup state: [feedback/STATUS.md](feedback/STATUS.md)
- Screenshot exchange: [feedback/screenshots](feedback/screenshots)
- Text output exchange: [feedback/logs](feedback/logs)

This is an independent Git repository, with its own history and `main` branch. It is not a fork or checkout of Smart Demand Manager. The handoff folder contains the selected, previously prepared script package; no application working tree, master workbooks, or source bridge files were copied.

R05.4 retains older imported revisions and disables automatic Delta purging while keeping the report's existing current-file selection. Its [README](handoff/notebook-r05.4/README.txt) gives the installation steps; [validation receipt](handoff/notebook-r05.4/VALIDATION.json) records the exact local checks. Receiving evidence on 20 October 2026 confirms a successful hourly refresh with a completed model refresh, followed by an UNCHANGED run that skipped the notebook. The every-day 08:00–17:00 London schedule is saved and active; the first automatic scheduled run remains pending.

The operator cannot access tenant settings and requires no IT involvement. The [user-context correction](handoff/pipeline-user-context-r01/README.md) was installed and its company hourly launch succeeded. The existing SharePoint Refresh Demand button and manually run controller also completed a request successfully. Automatic button pickup is still pending. The new native extension adds a producer and separate event worker, preserving the working hourly/controller items. Its installation and automatic event test remain separate receiving gates. Event listeners have ongoing capacity consumption; see the extension README before enabling a rule.

If Python is already available, `python tools/verify_handoff.py` verifies the copied handoff files against their recorded hashes. Python is not required to clone the repository, copy the installer into Fabric, or exchange screenshots.
